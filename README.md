# Java-Messenger
This is a Java messenger that takes advantage of the networking libraries present in java. It's a practice project that I made with the help from The New Boston Java tutorials. Thanks to Bucky Roberts.

In this, we have created a Server and a client/user. The Server side starts server and waits for connection. Then the client side can run and connect to server. Once a connection is setup. You can start messaging.

If an error occurs. Place the server & client files in different folders. Run ServerTest.java and then ClientTest.java.
Happy Messaging!
